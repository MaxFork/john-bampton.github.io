## Acknowledgements

Inspired by the GitHub community and the creativity of open-source developers.
Special thanks to all contributors and avatar owners included in this project.

The idea for this showcase site originally came from the movie [300](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)).
The plot revolves around King Leonidas (Gerard Butler), who leads 300 Spartans into
battle against the Persian "God-King" Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro). Here our showcase is
currently led by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds).
